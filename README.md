## Critical CSS generator

A CSS management tab provides easy access to all stylesheets on a page with options to download stylesheets, concatenate (merge) and an option to download multiple stylesheets in a ZIP package.

The Critical CSS generator was custom made and is able to provide a perfect result. It was inspired by [Penthouse.js](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse) and improved on many aspects including the use of PostCSS as a CSS parser. As a browser widget it has access to async injected stylesheets of the choice of the editor.
